# Fluent City Code Challenge

Write a function that takes in a english word as input and checks if it exists in the priovided `dictionary.txt` file. If it does exist then return all valid anagrams of that word sorted alphabetically by its **second** letter. For example:

```
solve_anagram('rates')

# Example Output: ['tares', 'rates', 'tears', 'aster', 'stare']
```
